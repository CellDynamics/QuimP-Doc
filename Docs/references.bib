abstract = {Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy is the preferred imaging mode for studying live unstained cells and embryos. This is mainly attributed to the optical sectioning capability which makes DIC suitable for three-dimensional microscopy. However, DIC images are not convenient for standard computerized image interpretation. We present here a processing algorithm that converts DIC images into a form which is much more amenable for such analysis. The algorithm is based on computational inversion of the directional gradient performed optically by DIC, namely path integration (line integrated DIC, or LID). LID images relate to the refractive index of the specimen, and are inherently positive in value, thus many powerful algorithms developed for fluorescent images can be applied to them. The method is demonstrated here for identifying and tracking nuclei in developing zebrafish embryos, and for reconstructing the shape of live leukocytes.},

	abstract = {Cell motility is an integral part of a diverse set of biological processes. The quest for mathematical models of cell motility has prompted the development of automated approaches for gathering quantitative data on cell morphology, and the distribution of molecular players involved in cell motility. Here we review recent approaches for quantifying cell motility, including automated cell segmentation and tracking. Secondly, we present our own novel method for tracking cell boundaries of moving cells, the Electrostatic Contour Migration Method (ECMM), as an alternative to the generally accepted level set method (LSM). ECMM smoothly tracks regions of the cell boundary over time to compute local membrane displacements using the simple underlying concept of electrostatics. It offers substantial speed increases and reduced computational overheads in comparison to the LSM. We conclude with general considerations regarding boundary tracking in the context of mathematical modelling.},

@article{Grady2006,
abstract = {A novel method is proposed for performing multilabel, interactive image segmentation. Given a small number of pixels with user-defined (or predefined) labels, one can analytically and quickly determine the probability that a random walker starting at each unlabeled pixel will first reach one of the prelabeled pixels. By assigning each pixel to the label for which the greatest probability is calculated, a high-quality image segmentation may be obtained. Theoretical properties of this algorithm are developed along with the corresponding connections to discrete potential theory and electrical circuits. This algorithm is formulated in discrete space (i.e., on a graph) using combinatorial analogues of standard operators and principles from continuous potential theory, allowing it to be applied in arbitrary dimension on arbitrary graphs.},
